               Release Notes for iSCSI Enterprise Target
               =========================================

                           October 5th, 2009
                             Version 1.4.18
                             --------------

The IET development team is pleased to announce the release of version
1.4.18 of the iSCSI Enterprise Target.

This release includes numerous bug fixes and compatibility improvements
and it is highly recommended that all production servers be on this
version for compatibility and stability reasons.

The version numbering of IET has changed in this release from the 0.X.X
series to the 1.X.X series. We did this because we felt that, since IET
has been stable and in production use for many years now, it deserved a
version number that better reflected that stability and maturity. We
are preserving the minor/maintenance numbers though in order to help
maintain some consistency between prior and future releases.

We would like to thank all those that contributed for this release. As
we are a small project we rely heavily on user contributions and we
welcome all who wish to participate in improving IET.

New since 0.4.17:

- Added support for recent kernel versions up to 2.6.31
- Added support for even more targets via:
	* multi PDU support during discovery
	* improved procfs support
	* global thread pool (module parameter)
- Added support to list all target addresses during discovery, with
  the ability to filter those addresses via targets.allow
- Replaced initiators.deny with an implicit deny on a failure to find
  a match in initiators.allow while preserving backwards compatiblity
  with existing installations (iff initiators.deny doesn't exist)
- Added ability to filter initiators by their IQNs as well as their
  IP addresses, using basic regex pattern to specify IQNs
- Moved the config files to /etc/iet/ while preserving backwards
  compatiblity with existing installations (iff a valid config file
  exists in the new location will it be used)
- Added support for Unit Attention Conditions
	* SCSI RESERVE/RELEASE now issues a UAC on reservation loss
- Added support for DKMS and building RPM packages right from the
  source archive (from either the source tar ball or subversion)

Plus many many bug and compatibility fixes (see ChangeLog for details)


Special thanks go to:

Shreyansh Jain, Lars Ellenberg, Ming Zhang, Francois Micaux, Cheng Renquan,
Andreas Florath, sdrb, Xie Gang, Stefan Rubner, FUJITA Tomonori, and to all
list members who submitted bug reports, suggestions and comments.

Without whose contributions this release would not have been possible.
