Introduction
-------------
iSCSI Enterprise Target is for building an iSCSI storage system on
Linux. It is aimed at developing an iSCSI target satisfying enterprise
requirements.

We borrow code from an Ardis iSCSI target (with respect to the GPL).


Installation
-------------
The iSCSI target requires a host running the Linux operating system
with a kernel version of 2.6.13 or newer. You need to enable 
"Cryptographic API" under "Cryptographic options" in the kernel config. 
You also need to enable "CRC32c CRC algorithm" if you use header or data 
digests. They are the kernel options, CONFIG_CRYPTO and CONFIG_CRYPTO_CRC32C,
respectively.

The iSCSI target consists of kernel modules and a daemon. The
compilation of the kernel modules require the path to above kernel
sources:

	make KERNELSRC=<kernel-src>

The path can also be set by editing the main Makefile. If KERNELSRC is omitted,
make program will try to locate the kernel sources for current running kernel.
Be sure to check whether it finds the right kernel sources.

This will build the modules, the daemon, and the control tool. To install both, 
use:

	make KERNELSRC=<kernel-src> install

The kernel modules will be install in the module directory of the
kernel. The daemon and the control tool will be installed as ietd and
ietadm under /usr/sbin. The boot script will be installed as
iscsi-targt under /etc/init.d.

If you use Linux distribution that does not have /etc/init.d, the
boot script will not be installed. So you need to install it to an
appropriate directory manually.


Configuration
-------------
The daemon is configured via the configuration file /etc/ietd.conf.
See the man page and the example file for the current syntax.

The ietadm utility is for managing IET software dynamically. You can
change the configurations of running targets. See the help message.

The access control based on initiator address and target name patterns
is configured via two configuration files (/etc/initiators.allow and
/etc/initiators.deny). These files work like tcpd files
(/etc/hosts.allow and /etc/hosts.deny). This feature enables you to
hide a particular targets from some initiators. See the example files
for the supported expressions. You can change the configuration
dynamically. The modifications to the files become effective
immediately.


Starting
-------------
The target is not started automatically. So execute:

	/etc/init.d/iscsi-target start

Note that you must edit the configuration file before starting the
target.


Stopping
-------------
Execute:

	/etc/init.d/iscsi-target stop
